# rokuAlexa
An Amazon Alexa app that controls a Roku TV with voice commands through the use of the Alexa, the Roku API, and the python library Flask-Ask. The application is hosted on a Raspberry Pi (verified through ngrok) server that uses Amazon to figure out voice intents which in turn convert to commands that will later be sent to Roku to perform actions.
